# Work and Mechanical Energy

Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on Work and Mechanical Energy. Today we will be exploring the relationship between work and energy. We will begin with a brief overview of the concept and then dive into the main sections that break down the concept. We will also provide example problems for each section to help solidify your understanding. Let's get started!

## Introduction

Work is a measure of energy transfer that occurs when a force is applied to an object and that object is displaced. Mechanical energy, on the other hand, is the sum of an object's kinetic energy and potential energy. The concept of work and mechanical energy is essential to understand how objects move and interact with their environment. 

## Section 1: Work

To begin, let's define work formally. The formula for work is:

$$W = F * d * \cos{\theta}$$

Where W is work, F is the force applied, d is the distance moved, and θ is the angle between the force and the displacement. Work is measured in Joules (J). 

There are three scenarios in which work can be done on an object. Positive work is done when the force and displacement are in the same direction, negative work is done when the force and displacement are in opposite directions, and no work is done when the force is perpendicular to the displacement. 

### Example Problem 1:

A box is pulled by a force of 20 N for a distance of 5 m. The angle between the force and the displacement is 45°. Find the work done on the box.

Solution:

$$W = F * d * \cos{\theta}$$
$$W = 20 * 5 * \cos{45°}$$
$$W = 70.7 J$$

The work done on the box is 70.7 J.

## Section 2: Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. The formula for kinetic energy is:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2} * m * v^2$$

Where KE is kinetic energy, m is the mass, and v is the velocity of the object. Kinetic energy is measured in Joules (J). 

### Example Problem 2:

A ball with a mass of 2 kg is moving at a velocity of 5 m/s. Find its kinetic energy.

Solution:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2} * m * v^2$$
$$KE = \frac{1}{2} * 2 * 5^2$$
$$KE = 25 J$$

The ball has a kinetic energy of 25 J.

## Section 3: Potential Energy

Potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration. The formula for potential energy is:

$$PE = m * g * h$$

Where PE is potential energy, m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height of the object. Potential energy is measured in Joules (J). 

### Example Problem 3:

A block with a mass of 5 kg is sitting on top of a shelf that is 2 m high. Find the potential energy of the block.

Solution:

$$PE = m * g * h$$
$$PE = 5 * 9.8 * 2$$
$$PE = 98 J$$

The block has a potential energy of 98 J.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, work and mechanical energy play a crucial role in understanding how objects move and interact with their environment. We covered the definition of work, how to calculate it, and the three scenarios in which work can be done on an object. We also explored kinetic energy and potential energy, including their formulas and how to calculate them. We hope that this lesson helped you understand the concept of work and mechanical energy better. Remember, practice makes perfect, so make sure you continue to work on example problems and explore the concept in more detail. Thank you for joining us today!
