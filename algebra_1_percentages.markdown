# Introduction\n\nHello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on **Percentage**. In Algebra 1, percentages play a pivotal role in many financial, scientific, and real-world problems. Understanding the concept of percentage is not only essential for academic success but also for daily life applications. Today, we will learn the meaning of percentage, its relationship with fractions and decimals, and how to convert between them. We will also discuss how to calculate percentage change, percentage increase, and percentage decrease. \n\n# Meanings of Percentage\n\nA percentage is a fraction with a denominator of 100. The symbol used to express a percentage is `%`. Percentages are used to express a part of a whole as a fraction of 100. For example, if you scored 80 out of 100 in a test, your percentage score can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\\text{Percentage Score} = \\frac{80}{100} \\times 100\\% = 80\\%$$\n\nSimilarly, if you scored 24 out of 30 in a quiz, your percentage score can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\\text{Percentage Score} = \\frac{24}{30} \\times 100\\% = 80\\%$$\n\n### Example Problem 1\n\nA fruit seller sold 60 out of 80 fruits. What was the percentage of fruits sold?\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo find the percentage of fruits sold, we need to divide the number of fruits sold by the total number of fruits and multiply by 100.\n\n$$Percentage = \\frac{60}{80} \\times 100\\% = 75\\%$$\n\nTherefore, the percentage of fruits sold by the seller was 75%.\n\n# Fractions and Decimals in Percentage\n\nPercentages can also be expressed as fractions or decimals. To convert a percentage to a fraction, we need to divide it by 100 and simplify the resulting fraction.\n\nFor example, to convert 25% to a fraction, we divide it by 100 and simplify.\n\n$$25\\% = \\frac{25}{100} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nTo convert a percentage to a decimal, we need to divide it by 100 and remove the `%` symbol.\n\nFor example, to convert 60% to a decimal, we divide it by 100 and remove the `%` symbol.\n\n$$60\\% = \\frac{60}{100} = 0.6$$\n\nSimilarly, to convert 8% to a decimal, we divide it by 100 and remove the `%` symbol.\n\n$$8\\% = \\frac{8}{100} = 0.08$$\n\n### Example Problem 2\n\nExpress 40% as a fraction and a decimal.\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo express 40% as a fraction, we divide it by 100 and simplify.\n\n$$40\\% = \\frac{40}{100} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\n\nTo express 40% as a decimal, we divide it by 100 and remove the `%` symbol.\n\n$$40\\% = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$$\n\nTherefore, 40% can be expressed as $\\frac{2}{5}$ or 0.4.\n\n# Percentage Change\n\nPercentage change refers to the increase or decrease in a quantity over time. The percentage change can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\times 100\\%$$\n\nIf the percentage change is positive, it represents a percentage increase. If the percentage change is negative, it represents a percentage decrease.\n\n### Example Problem 3\n\nThe price of a product increased from $50 to $60. What was the percentage increase in price?\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo find the percentage increase in price, we need to use the following formula:\n\n$$\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\times 100\\%$$\n\nIn this case, the old value (price) was $50 and the new value (price) was $60.\n\n$$\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\frac{60 - 50}{50} \\times 100\\% = 20\\%$$\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in price was 20%.\n\n### Example Problem 4\n\nThe attendance at a seminar decreased from 500 to 400. What was the percentage decrease in attendance?\n\n#### Solution\n\nTo find the percentage decrease in attendance, we need to use the following formula:\n\n$$\\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\frac{\\text{Old Value} - \\text{New Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\times 100\\%$$\n\nIn this case, the old value (attendance) was 500 and the new value (attendance) was 400.\n\n$$\\text{Percentage Decrease} = \\frac{500 - 400}{500} \\times 100\\% = 20\\%$$\n\nTherefore, the percentage decrease in attendance was 20%.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we have learned that percentages are fractions with a denominator of 100, used to express a part of a whole as a fraction of 100. We have also learned how to convert percentages to fractions and decimals and vice versa. Furthermore, we have discussed the concept of percentage change, how to calculate percentage increase and percentage decrease. I hope this lesson has been helpful, and you are now confident about solving percentage problems. Remember, practice makes perfect, and the more problems you solve, the more comfortable you will be with the c
