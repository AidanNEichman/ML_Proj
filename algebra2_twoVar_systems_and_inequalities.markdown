# Introduction

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Karu lesson on Two Variable Systems of Equations and Inequalities. In Algebra 2, we expand on the concept of linear equations by exploring systems of equations and inequalities with two variables. This concept is essential for solving real-world problems that involve multiple variables, such as optimizing production or analyzing financial data. In this lesson, we will cover the main parts of two variable systems, including solving systems of equations, graphing systems of equations, and solving systems of inequalities.

# Solving Systems of Equations

The first part of two variable systems is solving systems of equations. A system of equations is a set of two or more equations with the same variables, and we must find the values of the variables that satisfy all the equations simultaneously. We can solve systems of equations in several ways, including substitution and elimination. Substitution involves isolating one variable in one equation and substituting its value into the other equation. Elimination involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one variable and then solving for the other variable.

Suppose we have the system of equations $$\begin{align*}2x + 3y &= 12 \\4x - 3y &= 20\end{align*}$$
We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. For example, using substitution, we can isolate y in the first equation and substitute its value into the second equation. We get $$\begin{aligned}2x + 3y &= 12 \\4x - 3(4 - \frac{2x}{3}) &= 20\end{aligned}$$
Simplifying, we get $$\begin{aligned}2x + 3y &= 12 \\4x - 12 + 2x &= 20\end{aligned}$$
Solving for x, we get $x = 4$. Plugging this value into the first equation, we find that $y = 0$. Therefore, the solution to the system is $(4, 0)$.

# Graphing Systems of Equations

The second part of two variable systems is graphing systems of equations. We can graph a system of equations by graphing each equation on the same coordinate plane and finding the intersection point(s). The intersection point(s) represent the solution(s) to the system.

Suppose we have the system of equations $$\begin{aligned}y &= -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \\y &= 2x - 1\end{aligned}$$
We can graph each equation on the same coordinate plane and find the intersection point(s). Graphing the first equation, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}y &= -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \\y-intercept &= 3 \\x-intercept &= 6\end{aligned}$$
Graphing the second equation, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}y &= 2x - 1 \\y-intercept &= -1 \\x-intercept &= \frac{1}{2}\end{aligned}$$
The intersection point is $(2, 2)$, so the solution to the system is $(2, 2)$.

# Solving Systems of Inequalities

The third part of two variable systems is solving systems of inequalities. A system of inequalities is a set of two or more inequalities with the same variables, and we must find the values of the variables that satisfy all the inequalities simultaneously. We can solve systems of inequalities by graphing the inequalities on the same coordinate plane and finding the overlapping region(s). The overlapping region(s) represent the solution(s) to the system.

Suppose we have the system of inequalities $$\begin{aligned}y &\geq 2x - 1 \\y &\leq -\frac{1}{2}x + 5\end{aligned}$$
We can graph each inequality on the same coordinate plane and find the overlapping region(s). Graphing the first inequality, we shade everything above the line $y = 2x - 1$. Graphing the second inequality, we shade everything below the line $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 5$. The overlapping region is shaded, so the solution to the system is the shaded region.

# Example Problems

1) Solve the system $$\begin{aligned}2x - y &= 4 \\3x + 2y &= 10\end{aligned}$$

Solution: Using elimination, we can eliminate y by multiplying the first equation by 2 and adding the two equations. We get $$\begin{aligned}4x - 2y &= 8 \\3x + 2y &= 10\end{aligned}$$
Adding, we get $7x = 18$, so $x = \frac{18}{7}$. Plugging this value into the first equation, we find that $y = \frac{26}{7}$. Therefore, the solution to the system is $(\frac{18}{7}, \frac{26}{7})$.

2) Graph the system $$\begin{aligned}y &\geq 3x - 2 \\y &\leq x + 1\end{aligned}$$

Solution: Graphing the first inequality, we shade everything above the line $y = 3x - 2$. Graphing the second inequality, we shade everything below the line $y = x + 1$. The overlapping region is shaded, so the solution to the system is the shaded region.
