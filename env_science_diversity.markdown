# Introduction
Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on Diversity indices. In this lecture, we will explore the concept of Diversity indices and its significance in Environmental Science. Diversity indices are used to measure the diversity and richness of species in a particular ecosystem. They are essential in determining the health of an ecosystem and can help us make informed decisions on conservation and management practices. We will discuss the various types of diversity indices and how they are calculated, as well as the interpretation of results and their limitations.

# Section 1: What are Diversity Indices?
A diversity index is a measure of the variability of species in an ecosystem. Simply put, it is a way to measure the diversity and richness of species in a given area. It is usually calculated by taking into account the number of species present and their relative abundance. Diversity indices can be used to compare different ecosystems and monitor changes in biodiversity over time.

There are several types of diversity indices, including species richness, Simpson’s diversity, Shannon’s diversity, and the evenness index. Each of these indices measures a different aspect of biodiversity and provides unique insights into the ecosystem's health.

## Species Richness
Species richness is simply the number of different species present in a given area. It is the most basic measure of diversity and the easiest to calculate. To calculate the species richness, you simply count the number of different species present in the area. 

$$\text{Species Richness = Number of Species Present}$$

## Simpson's Diversity Index
Simpson's diversity index measures the probability that two individuals randomly chosen from a sample will belong to the same species. In other words, it takes into account the number of individuals belonging to each species rather than just the number of species present.

$$\text{D = } \sum_{i=1}^{s} \frac{n_i(n_i-1)}{N(N-1)}$$

Where D is Simpson's diversity index, s is the number of species, ni is the number of individuals in the ith species, N is the total number of individuals and $\sum$ means sum over i=1 to s. 

## Shannon's Diversity Index
Shannon's diversity index takes into account both the number of species present and the relative abundance of each species. It is calculated as follows:

$$\text{H'} = - \sum_{i=1}^{s}p_i \ln(p_i)$$

Where H' is Shannon's diversity index, s is the number of species, pi is proportion of individuals belonging to the ith species, and $\sum$ means sum over i=1 to s. 

## Evenness Index
Evenness index measures the relative abundance of different species in an ecosystem. It takes into account the distribution of individuals among different species. Ecosystems with high evenness will have a more balanced distribution of individuals among species, while those with low evenness will have a more skewed distribution.

$$\text{E} = \frac{H'}{\ln S}$$

Where E is the evenness index, H' is Shannon's diversity index, and S is the number of species present.

# Section 2: Interpreting Diversity Indices
Diversity indices provide valuable insights into the health and dynamics of ecosystems. A high diversity index indicates a healthy and robust ecosystem, while a low diversity index indicates a degraded and vulnerable ecosystem. Changes in diversity indices over time can indicate changes in the ecosystem, such as the introduction of invasive species or changes in environmental conditions.

It is important to note that diversity indices have some limitations. They do not provide information on the quality of the habitat, the interactions between species, and the genetic diversity of species. Therefore, they should be used in conjunction with other measures to gain a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem.

# Example Problems
## Problem 1
Calculate the Simpson's diversity index for a sample with the following data:

| Species | Number of individuals |
|---------|---------------------|
| A       | 10                  |
| B       | 5                   |
| C       | 3                   |
| D       | 2                   |

Solution:

Total number of individuals = 20

D = (10/20)^2 + (5/20)^2 + (3/20)^2 + (2/20)^2
D = 0.475

Therefore, the Simpson's diversity index for the sample is 0.475.

## Problem 2
Calculate the Shannon's diversity index for a sample with the following data:

| Species | Number of individuals |
|---------|---------------------|
| A       | 10                  |
| B       | 5                   |
| C       | 3                   |
| D       | 2                   |

Solution:

Total number of individuals = 20

pA = 10/20 = 0.5

pB = 5/20 = 0.25

pC = 3/20 = 0.15

pD = 2/20 = 0.1

H' = -(0.5*log(0.5) + 0.25*log(0.25) + 0.15*log(0.15) + 0.1*log(0.1))
H' = 1.78

Therefore, the Shannon's diversity index for the sample is 1.78.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, Diversity indices are important tools for measuring the diversity and richness of species in an ecosystem. They provide valuable insights into the health and dynamics of ecosystems and can help us make informed decisions on conservation and management practices. However, they have some limitations and should be used in conjunction with other measures to gain a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem. By understanding and using Diversity indices, we can work towards preserving and protecting our planet's biodiversity.
