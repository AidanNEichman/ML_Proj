# Project: "Optimizing Player Rest in Baseball using Machine Learning"

# Introduction: 
The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to analyze the
performance of individual baseball players on a team and predict the optimal
rest periods for each player given the schedule of opponents. By analyzing
player performance data and considering factors such as the difficulty of
upcoming opponents, the strength of opposing teams, and the player's recent
performance, we aim to identify the optimal rest schedule for each player to
maximize performance and prevent injury.

# Methodology:
- Collect and clean player performance data from various sources such as MLB
  statistics and player tracking data.
- Develop a model using C++ and Python to analyze the performance data and
  predict optimal rest periods for each player.
- This model will be based on Machine learning algorithms like Random Forest,
  XGBoost, Neural Network and will be implemented using libraries like
scikit-learn, Tensorflow.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy and
  precision.
Use the model to predict rest periods for players on a given schedule of
opponents.

# Expected Outcomes:

- Improved performance and reduced injury risk for individual players on the
  team.
- A model that can be used to optimize rest schedules for other teams in the
  league.
- Improved understanding of the factors that affect player performance and the
  role of rest in maintaining peak performance.

# Timeline:

- Data collection and cleaning: 3 weeks
- Model development and debugging: 5 weeks
- Model evaluation and improvement: 2 weeks
