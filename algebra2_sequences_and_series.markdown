# Introduction
Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on **Understanding Geometric Sequences**. In this lesson, we will dive deep into understanding geometric sequences and how they work. Geometric sequences are an essential part of Algebra 2, and understanding them will aid you in many other areas of math as well. So, let's get ready to take a deep dive into the world of geometric sequences.

# Section 1: What are Geometric Sequences?
Geometric sequences are sequences that follow a specific pattern. Each number in the sequence is a multiple of the number that comes before it. We call this number the common ratio ($r$). The first term of the sequence is $a_1$. We get each subsequent term by multiplying the previous term by $r$. Thus, the $n$th term of the geometric sequence is given by the formula $$a_n=a_1*r^{n-1}$$

Let's take a look at an example of a geometric sequence. Suppose we have $a_1=1$ and $r=2$. Then, the first few terms of the sequence would be $1, 2, 4, 8, 16,\dots$. We can see that each term is twice the previous term, and thus this is a geometric sequence.

# Section 2: Finding the Common Ratio
To find the common ratio of a geometric sequence, we simply take any term in the sequence and divide it by the term that comes before it. Suppose we have the geometric sequence $3, 6, 12, 24, 48,\dots$. To find the common ratio, we can take any term and divide it by the term before it. Let's take the second and third terms, $6$ and $12$. We can see that $12/6=2$. Thus, the common ratio of this geometric sequence is $2$.

# Section 3: Finding the nth term of a Geometric Sequence
To find the $n$th term of a geometric sequence, we use the formula $$a_n=a_1*r^{n-1}$$ where $a_1$ is the first term of the sequence and $r$ is the common ratio. Suppose we have the geometric sequence $1, 3, 9, 27, 81, \dots$. To find the 6th term of the sequence, we simply plug in the values we know into the formula. Thus, the 6th term of the sequence is $$a_6=1*3^{6-1}=729$$

# Section 4: Finding the Sum of a Geometric Sequence
To find the sum of a geometric sequence, we use the formula $$S_n=\frac{a_1(r^n-1)}{r-1}$$ where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence, $a_1$ is the first term of the sequence, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms we want to sum. Suppose we have the geometric sequence $1, 2, 4, 8, 16,\dots$ and we want to find the sum of the first 5 terms. Using the formula, we get $$S_5=\frac{1(2^5-1)}{2-1}=31$$ Thus, the sum of the first 5 terms of the sequence is 31.

# Example Problems
Let's take a look at some example problems to solidify our understanding of geometric sequences.

Example 1: Find the common ratio of the geometric sequence $1, 4, 16, 64,\dots$

Solution: To find the common ratio of the sequence, we can take any term and divide it by the term before it. Let's take the second and third terms, $4$ and $16$. We can see that $16/4=4$. Thus, the common ratio of this geometric sequence is $4$.

Example 2: Find the 10th term of the geometric sequence $5, 10, 20, 40,\dots$

Solution: To find the 10th term of the sequence, we use the formula we learned earlier. Thus, the 10th term of the sequence is $$a_{10}=5*2^{10-1}=2560$$

Example 3: Find the sum of the first 8 terms of the geometric sequence $2, 4, 8, 16, 32,\dots$

Solution: To find the sum of the first 8 terms, we use the formula we learned earlier. Thus, the sum of the first 8 terms of the sequence is $$S_8=\frac{2(2^8-1)}{2-1}=510$$

# Conclusion
In conclusion, geometric sequences are sequences that follow a specific pattern where each term is a multiple of the previous term. The formula for finding the $n$th term of a geometric sequence is $$a_n=a_1*r^{n-1}$$ and the formula for finding the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence is $$S_n=\frac{a_1(r^n-1)}{r-1}$$. Understanding geometric sequences is an essential part of Algebra 2 and will aid you in many other areas of math as well. Keep practicing and exploring the concept to strengthen your understanding.
