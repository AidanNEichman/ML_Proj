# Introduction

Hello everyone! Welcome to the Karu lesson on **Geometric Sequences**. In this lesson, we will dive into the world of sequences and explore how geometric sequences work. A sequence is a list of numbers that follow a certain pattern. In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant number, which is called the **common ratio**. We will go through all the major aspects of geometric sequences step by step, so let's get started!

# Main Sections

## Definition of a Geometric Sequence

To define a geometric sequence, we need to know the first term (a<sub>1</sub>) and the common ratio (r). The formula for finding the n-th term of a geometric sequence is:

$$a_{n}=a_{1}\cdot r^{n-1}$$

Here, n is the position of the term in the sequence. For example, if we have a geometric sequence with a<sub>1</sub> = 2 and r = 3, the first few terms would be:

a<sub>1</sub> = 2

a<sub>2</sub> = 2&nbsp;$\cdot$&nbsp;3<sup>1</sup> = 6

a<sub>3</sub> = 2&nbsp;$\cdot$&nbsp;3<sup>2</sup> = 18

a<sub>4</sub> = 2&nbsp;$\cdot$&nbsp;3<sup>3</sup> = 54

And so on...

## Finding the n-th Term of a Geometric Sequence

Using the formula we just learned, we can find any term in a geometric sequence. Let's take the same example we used earlier: a<sub>1</sub> = 2 and r = 3. If we want to find the 6th term, we can use the formula:

$$a_{6}=2\cdot 3^{5}=2\cdot 243=486$$

So the 6th term is 486.

## Finding the Sum of a Geometric Sequence

Now, let's move on to finding the sum of a geometric sequence. There are two formulas we can use, depending on whether we want to find the sum of a finite or infinite geometric sequence.

### Sum of a Finite Geometric Sequence

If we want to find the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence, we can use the formula:

$$S_{n}=a_{1}\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}$$

Here, S<sub>n</sub> represents the sum of the first n terms of the sequence. Let's use the same example we've been working with: a<sub>1</sub> = 2 and r = 3. If we want to find the sum of the first 5 terms, we can use the formula:

$$S_{5}=2\frac{1-3^{5}}{1-3}=2\frac{1-243}{-2}=242$$

So the sum of the first 5 terms is 242.

### Sum of an Infinite Geometric Sequence

If we want to find the sum of an infinite geometric sequence (i.e., a sequence with an infinite number of terms), we can use the formula:

$$S_{\infty}=\frac{a_{1}}{1-r}$$

Here, S<sub>&infin;</sub> represents the sum of the infinite geometric sequence. Let's use the same values we've been working with: a<sub>1</sub> = 2 and r = 3. If we want to find the sum of the infinite sequence, we can use the formula:

$$S_{\infty}=\frac{2}{1-3}=-\frac{2}{2}=-1$$

So the sum of the infinite geometric sequence is -1.

# Example Problems

Let's work through some example problems to solidify our understanding of geometric sequences.

## Example Problem 1

Find the 8th term of the geometric sequence with a<sub>1</sub> = 3 and r = 4.

### Solution

We can use the formula we learned earlier:

$$a_{n}=a_{1}\cdot r^{n-1}$$

Plugging in the values we were given, we get:

$$a_{8}=3\cdot 4^{7}=393216$$

So the 8th term is 393216.

## Example Problem 2

Find the sum of the first 7 terms of the geometric sequence with a<sub>1</sub> = 2 and r = 5.

### Solution

We can use the formula we learned earlier:

$$S_{n}=a_{1}\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}$$

Plugging in the values we were given, we get:

$$S_{7}=2\frac{1-5^{7}}{1-5}=78124$$

So the sum of the first 7 terms is 78124.

# Conclusion

That's it for our lesson on geometric sequences! We learned that a geometric sequence is a list of numbers where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant number, called the common ratio. We also learned how to find the n-th term of a geometric sequence, as well as how to find the sum of a finite and infinite geometric sequence. Keep practicing with example problems, and don't be afraid to use the formulas we learned to check your work. Good luck!
