# **Introduction**
Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on **Summarizing a story, drama, or poem's theme from text details**! This is an important skill in English that will help you understand the message that the author is trying to convey in a literary work. In this lesson, we will go through the major aspects of this concept and explain each in detail. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to summarize the theme of a story, drama, or poem using the text details.

# **Sections**
## Section 1: What is a theme?
A theme is the main message or idea that an author is trying to communicate in a literary work. It is not the same as a plot, which is the sequence of events that make up the story. Rather, a theme is a universal idea or statement about life that the author wants the readers to take away from the work.

$$\text{Theme} = \text{universal idea or statement about life}$$

## Section 2: How to identify a theme?
Identifying a theme requires careful reading and analysis of the text. Here are some steps to follow:

1. Read the entire text to get a general sense of what it is about.
2. Identify the main characters and their conflicts.
3. Look for patterns or recurring elements in the text, such as symbols or motifs.
4. Pay attention to the author's tone and language choices.
5. Consider the historical or cultural context in which the work was written.

Once you have analyzed the text using these steps, you should be able to identify the theme.

## Section 3: How to write a summary of the theme?
Writing a summary of the theme involves condensing the universal idea or statement about life into a single sentence. Here are some steps to follow:

1. Identify the universal idea or statement about life that the author is communicating.
2. Condense it into a single sentence that captures the essence of the theme.
3. Use specific examples from the text to support your summary.

Here's an example of a summary of the theme of the novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee:

> In "To Kill a Mockingbird," Harper Lee communicates the theme that prejudice and injustice exist in society and can have harmful effects on individuals through her portrayal of the trial of Tom Robinson and the treatment of Boo Radley.

# **Example Problems**
