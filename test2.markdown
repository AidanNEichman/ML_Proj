# Introduction

Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on Entropy. Entropy is a concept that is extremely important in the field of thermodynamics and has many practical applications in our daily lives. To put it simply, entropy is the measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. In this lecture, we will be breaking down the concept of entropy into smaller parts to understand it better.

# Section 1: Defining Entropy

Entropy is defined as the measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. In other words, it is the amount of energy that is unavailable to do work. The symbol for entropy is S, and it is measured in units of joules per kelvin (J/K). The entropy of a system can increase or decrease, depending on the processes occurring within the system.

$$\Delta S = S_{final}-S_{initial}$$

Where $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy, and $S_{final}$ and $S_{initial}$ are the final and initial entropies, respectively.

# Section 2: The Second Law of Thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system always tends to increase over time. This law can be expressed in terms of the equation:

$$\Delta S_{universe} > 0$$

Where $\Delta S_{universe}$ is the change in entropy of the entire system, including the surroundings. This means that in any process, the total entropy of the universe must always increase. 

# Section 3: Entropy of a Gas

The entropy of a gas can be calculated using the following equation:

$$S=nR\ln(V_f/V_i)$$

Where S is the entropy change, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and $V_f$ and $V_i$ represent the final and initial volumes, respectively. 

Example problem:
Calculate the entropy change when 2 moles of an ideal gas with an initial volume of 5 L expands to a final volume of 20 L at a constant temperature of 298 K.

Solution:
Using the equation above, we get:

$$S= 2\cdot8.314\text{ J/K}\cdot\ln(20\text{ L}/5\text{ L})$$
$$S= 2\cdot8.314\text{ J/K}\cdot\ln(4)$$
$$S= 2\cdot8.314\text{ J/K}\cdot 1.3862$$
$$S= 23.08\text{ J/K}$$

Therefore, the entropy change was 23.08 J/K.

# Section 4: Entropy of a Solid

The entropy change of a solid can be calculated using the equation:

$$\Delta S = C_p\ln(T_f/T_i) - R\ln(P_f/P_i)$$

Where $\Delta S$ is the change in entropy, $C_p$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, T is the temperature, and P is the pressure. 

Example problem:
Calculate the entropy change when a solid with a specific heat capacity of 20 J/(mol•K) is heated from 298 K to 328 K at a constant pressure of 1 atm.

Solution:
Using the equation above, we get:

$$\Delta S = 20\text{ J/(mol}\cdot\text{K)}\cdot\ln(328\text{ K}/298\text{ K}) - 8.314\text{ J/(mol}\cdot\text{K)}\cdot\ln(1\text{ atm}/1\text{ atm})$$
$$\Delta S = 20\text{ J/(mol}\cdot\text{K)}\cdot\ln(1.1013) - 0$$
$$\Delta S = 20\text{ J/(mol}\cdot\text{K)}\cdot 0.09691$$
$$\Delta S = 1.9382\text{ J/(mol}\cdot\text{K)}$$

Therefore, the entropy change was 1.9382 J/(mol•K).

# Conclusion
In conclusion, entropy is an extremely important concept in the field of thermodynamics, and understanding it is crucial for understanding various physical and chemical processes. We have covered the basic definition of entropy, the second law of thermodynamics, and how to calculate the entropy of a gas and a solid. I encourage you to explore this concept further and to apply it to real-world situations. Thank you for watching this Karu lesson on entropy!
