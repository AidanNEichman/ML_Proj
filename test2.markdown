# Enthalpy of Formation: Introduction

Hello and welcome to the Karu lesson on Enthalpy of Formation! In this lesson, we will dive into the concept of enthalpy of formation, which is an important concept in thermodynamics. Before we begin, let's define enthalpy of formation.

Enthalpy of formation ($\Delta H^{\circ}_f$) is the enthalpy change that occurs when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.

In simple terms, it is the amount of heat released or absorbed when a compound is formed from its constituent elements. Now, let's break down the concept of enthalpy of formation into its main components.

## The Standard State

In order to calculate $\Delta H^{\circ}_f$ for a compound, we need to define what we mean by "standard states". The standard state of an element is its most stable state at a specified temperature and pressure. For example, the standard state of oxygen gas is diatomic O$_2$, and the standard state of mercury is liquid at room temperature.

## Hess's Law

Now that we know what standard states are, let's introduce Hess's Law. Hess's Law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is independent of the pathway between the initial and final states. In other words, the change in enthalpy for a reaction is the same regardless of whether the reaction occurs in one step or multiple steps. This allows us to use enthalpies of formation to determine the overall enthalpy change for a reaction.

## Enthalpy of Formation Calculation

To calculate $\Delta H^{\circ}_f$ for a compound, we need to know the enthalpies of formation for its constituent elements. These values are typically given in tables of standard thermodynamic values, such as the NIST Chemistry WebBook. Once we have these values, we can use Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy of formation for the compound.

### Enthalpy of Formation Equation

The general equation for calculating $\Delta H^{\circ}_f$ is:

$$\Delta H^{\circ}_f = \sum_{products}n\Delta H^{\circ}_f(\mathrm{products}) - \sum_{reactants}n\Delta H^{\circ}_f(\mathrm{reactants})$$

where $\Delta H^{\circ}_f(\mathrm{products})$ and $\Delta H^{\circ}_f(\mathrm{reactants})$ are the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants, respectively, and $n$ is the coefficient of each species in the balanced chemical equation.

Let's look at an example to see how this equation is used in practice.

## Example Problem

Calculate the enthalpy of formation of calcium chloride (CaCl$_2$) using the following enthalpies of formation:

$$\Delta H^{\circ}_f(\mathrm{Ca}) = -546.1 \ \mathrm{kJ/mol}$$

$$\Delta H^{\circ}_f(\mathrm{Cl_2}) = 0 \ \mathrm{kJ/mol}$$

$$\Delta H^{\circ}_f(\mathrm{CaCl_2}) = -795.8 \ \mathrm{kJ/mol}$$

### Solution

The balanced chemical equation for the formation of CaCl$_2$ is:

$$\mathrm{Ca(s)} + 2\mathrm{Cl_2(g)} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaCl_2(s)}$$

Using the $\Delta H^{\circ}_f$ values given above and the equation for calculating $\Delta H^{\circ}_f$, we can calculate the enthalpy of formation for CaCl$_2$:

$$\Delta H^{\circ}_f(\mathrm{CaCl_2}) = (1)(-795.8 \ \mathrm{kJ/mol}) - (1)(-546.1 \ \mathrm{kJ/mol}) - (2)(0 \ \mathrm{kJ/mol}) = -249.7 \ \mathrm{kJ/mol}$$

Therefore, the enthalpy of formation of CaCl$_2$ is -249.7 kJ/mol.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, enthalpy of formation is an important concept in thermodynamics that allows us to calculate the amount of heat released or absorbed when a compound is formed from its constituent elements. We use the enthalpies of formation for the elements and Hess's Law to calculate the enthalpy of formation for the compound. Remember, the key to success in understanding enthalpy of formation is to practice, practice, practice!
