# Introduction

Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on **Algebraic Expressions** from Icy Tutors. Algebraic Expressions is a fundamental topic that appears in math curriculums across different grade levels, including Grade 6. In this lesson, we will explore Algebraic Expressions in detail and understand how to apply this concept to solve problems. 

# Units

1. What are Algebraic Expressions
2. Like and Unlike Terms
3. Adding and Subtracting Expressions
4. Multiplying Expressions
5. Dividing Expressions

## Unit 1: What are Algebraic Expressions ##

Algebraic Expressions are mathematical phrases that involve variables, constants, and operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The variables in the expressions represent unknown values, while constants like numbers are known values. The operations indicate the operations required to perform calculations with the variables and constants. Examples of Algebraic Expressions include:

$$2x + 3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~6a + 4b~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~x^2 - 5x + 6$$

## Example Problem 1.1 
Write an Algebraic Expression for the statement: "five times a number plus two."

***Solution***: We can use the variable 'n' to represent the unknown number. $5n + 2$ is the Algebraic Expression that matches the given statement.

## Unit 2: Like and Unlike Terms ##

In Algebraic Expressions, terms are the parts of the expression that contain variables, constants, or a product of both. Like terms are the terms in an expression that have the same variables raised to the same power, while unlike terms have different variables or different powers of the same variables. Example of like and unlike terms are:

$$3x~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5x^2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~7y^3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-2x~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~9x^2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-5xy^2$$

## Example Problem 2.1
Identify the like and unlike terms in the expression: $3a^2 + 5ab - 2a^2 + 7b$

***Solution***: The like terms in the expression are $3a^2$ and $-2a^2$ because they both have the same power of 'a'. The unlike terms in the expression are $5ab$ and $7b$ because they have different variables.

## Unit 3: Adding and Subtracting Expressions ##

We can add or subtract Algebraic Expressions by grouping like terms. To add or subtract the coefficients of like terms, while keeping the variable and its corresponding exponent the same. Examples of adding and subtracting Algebraic Expressions are:

$$5x + 3y - 2x + 5y = 3x + 8y$$

$$6a^2b + 4b - 2ab^2 + 3ab + 7a^2b^2 = 7a^2b^2 + 6a^2b + ab^2 + 4b$$

## Example Problem 3.1

Simplify the expression: $2x + 5y + 3x - 2y$

***Solution***: We group the like terms and perform addition to obtain: $(2x + 3x) + (5y - 2y) = 5x + 3y$

##  Unit 4: Multiplying Expressions ## 

We can multiply Algebraic Expressions by applying the distributive property of multiplication. The distributive property implies:

$$(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$$

When multiplying two expressions, we apply the distributive property to each term in one expression with each term in the other. Example of multiplying Algebraic Expressions:

$$(2x + 3) \cdot (4y - 1) = 8xy - 2x + 12y - 3$$

## Example Problem 4.1

Multiply the expressions: $5x(2x + 3y)$

***Solution***: We apply the distributive property as: $5x \cdot 2x + 5x \cdot 3y = 10x^2 + 15xy$

## Unit 5: Dividing Expressions ##

To divide Algebraic Expressions, we can cancel out like terms by dividing their coefficients. To divide an expression by a monomial, we can separate each term and divide each coefficient separately. Example of dividing Algebraic Expressions are:

$$\frac{12km + 15kn}{3k} = 4m + 5n$$

$$\frac{3x^2y^3 - 9x^2y}{-3xy} = -xy^2 + 3x$$

## Example Problem 5.1

Simplify the expression: $\frac{56ab}{7a}$

***Solution***: We factor out 7a from the numerator as: $\frac{7a \cdot 8b}{7a} = 8b$.

# Conclusion

Algebraic Expressions are mathematical phrases that involve variables, constants, and operations. Like terms have the same variables raised to the same power, while unlike terms have different variables or different powers of the same variables. We can add, subtract, multiply, or divide Algebraic Expressions by performing operations based on the properties of the terms. To solve Algebraic Expressions, we need to follow a step-by-step method that ensures the information is accurate and consistent. As you continue learning Algebraic Expressions, keep practicing, and applying your math skills to solve more complex problems.
