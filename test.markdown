# Introduction
Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on Gravitational Forces from Icy Tutors. 

In this lesson, we will be discussing the concept of gravitational forces. Gravitational forces are the forces that exist between any two objects that have mass. The magnitude of this force depends on the masses of the objects and the distance between them. This concept is very important in physics and astronomy as it helps us study the behavior of celestial bodies like planets, stars, and galaxies.

# Units/Contents

To understand gravitational forces, we will break down the concept into smaller units and discuss each in detail.

## Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

The first unit is Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that the force of attraction between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

$$F=G\cdot\dfrac{m_1\cdot m_2}{r^2}$$

where: 

- F is the force of attraction between the two objects
- G is the universal gravitational constant (6.674×10−11 N ⋅ m^2/kg^2)
- m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects
- r is the distance between the two objects

Let's try an example problem:

**Example Problem 1:** Calculate the gravitational force of attraction between two objects with masses $m_1= 2\ kg$ and $m_2= 4\ kg$ separated by a distance of $r= 4\ m$.

**Solution:**

We have the values of $m_1$, $m_2$ and $r$. We can now use Newton's law of universal gravitation to find the force of attraction F.

$$F=G\cdot\dfrac{m_1\cdot m_2}{r^2}$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$F=6.674\times10^{-11}\cdot\dfrac{2\times 4}{4^2}$$ 

$$F=6.674\times10^{-11}\cdot\dfrac{8}{16}$$ 

$$F=3.34\times10^{-11}$$ 

Therefore, the gravitational force of attraction between the two objects is $3.34\times10^{-11}\ N$.

## Gravitational Field

The second unit is Gravitational Field. A gravitational field is a region around an object in which a mass would experience a gravitational force. The gravitational field strength is defined as the force experienced per unit mass.

$$g=\dfrac{F}{m}$$

where:

- g is the gravitational field strength
- F is the gravitational force of attraction between the object producing the gravitational field and the mass experiencing it
- m is the mass of the object experiencing the field

Let's try an example problem:

**Example Problem 2:** What is the gravitational field strength at a point 10 m away from a planet that has a mass of $2\times 10^{23}\ kg$?

**Solution:**

We are given the mass of the planet and the distance of the point from the planet. We can now use Newton's law of universal gravitation to find the gravitational force of attraction between the planet and a mass of $1\ kg$ at that point.

$$F=G\cdot\dfrac{m_1\cdot m_2}{r^2}$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$F=6.674\times10^{-11}\cdot\dfrac{2\times 10^{23}\cdot 1}{10^2}$$ 

$$F=1.34\times10^{12}\ N$$ 

The gravitational field strength is:

$$g=\dfrac{F}{m}$$

Substituting the value of F, we get:

$$g=\dfrac{1.34\times10^{12}}{1}$$ 

Therefore, the gravitational field strength at that point is $1.34\times10^{12}\ N\ kg^{-1}$.

## Circular Motion

The third unit is Circular Motion. Circular motion is the motion of an object in a circular path. For an object to move in a circular path, there has to be a centripetal force acting on it. In the case of planets moving around the sun, the centripetal force that keeps them in their orbits is the gravitational force of attraction between them and the sun.

$$F_{centripetal}=m\cdot\dfrac{v^2}{r}$$

where:

- Fcentripetal is the centripetal force
- m is the mass of the object
- v is the velocity of the object
- r is the radius of the circular path

Let's try an example problem:

**Example Problem 3:** A satellite of mass $500\ kg$ circles the earth at an altitude of $5000\ m$. What is the velocity of the satellite?

**Solution:**

Using the Law of Universal Gravitation, we can find the force of attraction between the satellite and the earth.

$$F=G\cdot\dfrac{m_1\cdot m_2}{r^2}$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$F=6.674\times10^{-11}\cdot\dfrac{(500\cdot 5.97\times10^{24})}{(6.38\times10^6+5\times10^3)^2}$$

$$F=2.71\times10^6\ N$$

We can use this to find the velocity of the satellite using the centripetal force equation.

$$F_{centripetal}=m\cdot\dfrac{v^2}{r}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$2.71\times10^6=500\cdot\dfrac{v^2}{6.38\times10^6+5\times10^3}$$

Solving for v, we get:

$v=7662.6\ m\ s^{-1}$

Therefore, the velocity of the satellite is $7662.6\ m\ s^{-1}$.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, gravitational forces are the forces that exist between any two objects that have mass. We looked at Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which gives us a formula to calculate the gravitational force of attraction between two objects, Gravitational Field, which helps us calculate the gravitational field strength at a point, and Circular Motion, which helps us understand the motion of objects in a circular path under the influence of gravitational forces.

I hope this lesson has helped you understand gravitational forces better. Remember to practice more problems and explore the concept even further. Thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next lesson!
