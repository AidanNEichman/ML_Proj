# Introduction

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Karu lesson on Gibbs free energy and thermodynamic favorability. I am your tutor from Icy Tutors, and I am excited to discuss this concept with you today. Gibbs free energy is a fundamental concept in analytical chemistry that helps us understand the direction in which chemical reactions proceed. It is essential in determining whether a reaction is thermodynamically favorable or not. In this lesson, we will explore the concept of Gibbs free energy, thermodynamic favorability, and how to calculate these values.

# Units

## The Concept of Gibbs Free Energy
Gibbs free energy, represented by the letter G, is the maximum amount of energy that can be used to do work in a system at constant temperature and pressure. It is the energy that is available to initiate a chemical or physical change in a system. The Gibbs free energy of a reaction, ΔG, is calculated by subtracting the product of temperature and entropy from the change in enthalpy of the reaction. 

$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\cdot\Delta S$$

Where ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the change in entropy. 

### Example Problem
Calculate the Gibbs free energy for the reaction: 

2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(g) 

Given that ΔH = -484 kJ/mol, and ΔS = -198 J/mol*K at 298 K.

#### Solution
- Convert ΔS from J/mol*K to kJ/mol*K: ΔS = -0.198 kJ/mol*K
- Plug in the values in the equation: 

$$\Delta G = -484 \text{ kJ/mol} - 298 \text{ K} \cdot (-0.198 \text{ kJ/mol*K})$$

- Solve for ΔG: 

$$\Delta G = -484 \text{ kJ/mol} + 59 \text{ kJ/mol} = -425 \text{ kJ/mol}$$

Therefore, the Gibbs free energy for this reaction is -425 kJ/mol, indicating a spontaneous reaction.

## Thermodynamic Favorability
A spontaneous reaction is one that occurs naturally without any external influence. A reaction is said to be thermodynamically favorable if it has a negative Gibbs free energy value, meaning that the reaction can proceed spontaneously without the need for additional energy input. Conversely, a reaction with a positive Gibbs free energy value is thermodynamically unfavorable, meaning that energy must be added to the system for the reaction to occur. 

### Example Problem
Determine the spontaneity of the following reaction at 298K, given the standard enthalpy and entropy values:

2SO2(g) + O2(g) -> 2SO3(g)

Given that ΔH = -197 kJ/mol and ΔS = -168 J/mol*K.

#### Solution
- Convert ΔS to kJ/mol*K: ΔS = -0.168 kJ/mol*K.
- Plug in the values in the equation: 

$$\Delta G = -197 \text{ kJ/mol} - 298\text{ K} \cdot (-0.168 \text{ kJ/mol*K})$$

- Solve for ΔG: 

$$\Delta G = -197 \text{ kJ/mol} + 50.064 \text{ kJ/mol} = -147.94 \text{ kJ/mol}$$

Since ΔG is negative, this reaction is thermodynamically favorable and will proceed spontaneously.

## Relationship between Equilibrium Constant and Gibbs Free Energy
The equilibrium constant, K, is a measure of the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants in a chemical reaction at equilibrium. The Gibbs free energy change for a reaction, ΔG, is related to the equilibrium constant through the following equation:

$$\Delta G = -RT\ln K$$

Where R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and ln is the natural logarithm. 

### Example Problem
Determine the equilibrium constant for the following reaction at 25°C, given the Gibbs free energy value is -13.8 kJ/mol:

2NO(g) + Cl2(g) -> 2NOCl(g)

#### Solution
- Convert the temperature to Kelvin: T = 298K.
- Convert Gibbs free energy to J/mol: ΔG = -13800 J/mol.
- Plug in the values in the equation: 

$$-13800 \text{ J/mol} = -8.31 \text{ J/mol*K} \cdot 298 \text{ K} \cdot \ln K$$

- Solve for K: 

$$K = e^{\frac{-13800 \text{ J/mol}}{(-8.31 \text{ J/mol*K} \cdot 298 \text{ K})}} = 1.61 \times 10^5$$

Thus, the equilibrium constant for this reaction is 1.61 × 10^5.

# Conclusion

In summary, Gibbs free energy is a critical concept in analytical chemistry that determines the thermodynamic favorability of a chemical reaction. If ΔG is negative, the reaction will proceed spontaneously and is said to be thermodynamically favorable. If ΔG is positive, the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable, and energy must be added to the system for the reaction to occur. The relationship between ΔG and equilibrium constant K can also be used to determine the equilibrium position of a reaction. I hope you now have a better understanding of Gibbs free energy and thermodynamic favorability. Good luck with your chemistry studies!
