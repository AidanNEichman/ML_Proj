# Introduction

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Karu lesson on Simple Interest. Today, we will explore the exciting world of finance and learn about how we can make our money work for us. Simple Interest is an essential concept in finance, and understanding it will help us in managing our finances better.

# Section 1: Understanding Simple Interest

Simple Interest is a way of calculating the interest on a loan or an investment. It is called "simple" because it is calculated based on the principal amount and the interest rate, without taking into account any other factors like compounding. The formula for Simple Interest can be expressed as:

$$\text{Simple Interest} = P \cdot r \cdot t$$

Where,
- P is the principal amount
- r is the interest rate per year (as a decimal)
- t is the time period (in years)

Let's take an example to understand this better.

## Example 1: Calculating Simple Interest

Suppose you loaned your friend $100 for a year at an interest rate of 10%. What is the Simple Interest that you will earn?

**Solution:**

Here, 
- P = $100
- r = 0.10 (10% as a decimal)
- t = 1 (1 year)

So, 

$$\text{Simple Interest} = 100 \cdot 0.10 \cdot 1 = 10$$

Therefore, the Simple Interest earned is $10.

# Section 2: Finding the Total Amount

The Simple Interest formula gives us the interest earned on the principal amount, but it does not give us the total amount, which includes the principal amount and the interest earned. To find the Total Amount, we need to add the Simple Interest to the Principal Amount. The formula for Total Amount can be expressed as:

$$\text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest}$$

Let's take an example to understand this better.

## Example 2: Finding the Total Amount

Using the same example as before, what is the Total Amount that your friend will have to pay you back at the end of the year?

**Solution:**

Here, 
- P = $100
- Simple Interest = $10

So, 

$$\text{Total Amount} = 100 + 10 = 110$$

Therefore, the Total Amount that your friend will have to pay you back at the end of the year is $110.

# Section 3: Finding the Interest Rate

Sometimes, we may know the Principal Amount, the Total Amount, and the Time Period, but we may not know the Interest Rate. In such cases, we can use the formula for Interest Rate to find out what the rate of interest was. The formula for Interest Rate can be expressed as:

$$r = \frac{\text{Simple Interest}}{P \cdot t}$$

Let's take an example to understand this better.

## Example 3: Finding the Interest Rate

Suppose you invested $5000 for 2 years and earned a Simple Interest of $800. What was the Interest Rate?

**Solution:**

Here, 
- P = $5000
- Simple Interest = $800
- t = 2 years

So, 

$$r = \frac{800}{5000 \cdot 2} = 0.08$$

Therefore, the Interest Rate was 8% per year.
