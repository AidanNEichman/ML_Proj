Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on Two-way Tables & Association between Variables from Icy Tutors.

Two-way tables are cross-classification tables that organize data in rows and columns. They allow us to visually represent the relationship between two categorical variables and their corresponding frequencies. In this lesson, we will be discussing the concept of two-way tables and how to use them to identify and analyze the association between variables.

Before we move forward, let's clarify what categorical variables are. Categorical variables are variables whose observations are divided into categories or groups. Examples of categorical variables include gender, hair color, favorite food, etc.

Now, let's dive into two-way tables. A two-way table is a table which displays the frequencies of two categorical variables in specific categories. The rows of the table represent one variable, while the columns represent the other variable. Here's a simple example of a two-way table:

$$ \begin{matrix} & Sport & Movies & Music \\ Male & 20 & 15 & 5 \\ Female & 10 & 25 & 15 \end{matrix} $$ 

In this example, we have two categorical variables: gender (male or female) and preferred form of entertainment (sport, movies, or music). The table displays the frequencies of each gender's preferred form of entertainment. We can use this table to determine if there is an association between gender and preferred form of entertainment.

Now let's talk about association. Association is the relationship or connection between two variables. In the context of a two-way table, it refers to whether or not there is a relationship between the two categorical variables being studied. An association can be positive, negative, or neutral. A positive association occurs when the frequency of one variable increases as the frequency of the other variable increases. A negative association occurs when the frequency of one variable decreases as the frequency of the other variable increases. A neutral association occurs when there is no relationship between the two variables.

To determine the association between two variables in a two-way table, we can calculate the conditional frequencies. Conditional frequencies are the frequency of one variable for each category of the other variable. We can calculate the conditional frequency by dividing the frequency of the cell by the total frequency of the row or column it belongs to. Here's how we can calculate the conditional frequency for the first cell in the table above:

$$\frac{20}{20+15+5}=0.57 $$

This means that 57% of males prefer sports as their form of entertainment.

Now let's work through an example problem. Consider the following two-way table:

$$ \begin{matrix} & High School & College & University \\ Male & 50 & 20 & 10 \\ Female & 45 & 30 & 25 \end{matrix} $$ 

We want to determine if there is an association between gender and level of education.

First, we can begin by calculating the row percentages. Row percentages are the percentages of each gender's frequency for each level of education. Here are the row percentages:

$$ \begin{matrix} & High School & College & University \\ Male & 62.5\% & 25\% & 12.5\% \\ Female & 50\% & 33.3\% & 16.7\% \end{matrix} $$ 

From this table, we can see that a higher proportion of males are in high school compared to college or university, while a higher proportion of females are in high school or college compared to university. However, we need to calculate more to determine the association between gender and level of education. 

Next, we can calculate the column percentages. Column percentages are the percentages of each level of education's frequency for each gender. Here are the column percentages:

$$ \begin{matrix} & High School & College & University \\ Male & 52.6\% & 40.0\% & 28.6\% \\ Female & 47.4\% & 60.0\% & 71.4\% \end{matrix} $$ 

From the column percentages, we can see that a higher proportion of males are in high school compared to females, while a higher proportion of females are in college or university compared to males. 

By comparing the row and column percentages, we can conclude that there is an association between gender and level of education. Specifically, gender and level of education are negatively associated, as the proportion of males in high school is higher than that of females, while the proportion of females in college or university is higher than that of males.

In conclusion, two-way tables are an effective tool for visually representing the relationship between two categorical variables and their corresponding frequencies. By calculating conditional frequencies, we can identify and analyze associations between variables. Remember to always calculate both the row and column percentages in order to accurately determine the association between two variables in a two-way table.
