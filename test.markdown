# Introduction

Hello everyone, welcome to the Grade 8 Math lesson on Characteristics of Graphs from Icy Tutors. Today, we will be discussing how to identify the different characteristics that a graph can have, such as its slope, intercept, axis, and curvature. Understanding these characteristics will help you to interpret graphs more effectively and solve problems more efficiently.

## Slope

The slope of a line is a measure of its steepness. It is defined as the ratio of the change in the y-coordinate to the change in the x-coordinate between two points on the line. The slope can be positive, negative, zero, or undefined.

### Positive Slope

A positive slope means that the line is increasing as you move from left to right. For example, the line y = 2x + 1 has a slope of 2, which means that for every increase of 1 in the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate increases by 2.

#### Example Problem

Find the slope of the line that passes through the points (1, 3) and (4, 9).

Solution:

The change in y-coordinate is 9 - 3 = 6, and the change in x-coordinate is 4 - 1 = 3. Therefore, the slope is:

$$
slope = \frac{6}{3} = 2
$$

### Negative Slope

A negative slope means that the line is decreasing as you move from left to right. For example, the line y = -2x + 5 has a slope of -2, which means that for every increase of 1 in the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate decreases by 2.

#### Example Problem

Find the slope of the line that passes through the points (1, 5) and (5, 1).

Solution:

The change in y-coordinate is 1 - 5 = -4, and the change in x-coordinate is 5 - 1 = 4. Therefore, the slope is:

$$
slope = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
$$

### Zero Slope

A zero slope means that the line is horizontal. For example, the line y = 4 has a slope of 0, which means that for every increase of 1 in the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate remains the same.

#### Example Problem

Find the slope of the horizontal line that passes through the point (2, 7).

Solution:

Since the line is horizontal, the change in y-coordinate is 0 and the change in x-coordinate is 1. Therefore, the slope is:

$$
slope = \frac{0}{1} = 0
$$

### Undefined Slope

An undefined slope means that the line is vertical. For example, the line x = 4 has an undefined slope, which means that for every increase of 1 in the y-coordinate, the x-coordinate remains the same.

#### Example Problem

Find the slope of the vertical line that passes through the point (5, -3).

Solution:

Since the line is vertical, the change in x-coordinate is 0 and the change in y-coordinate is 1. Therefore, the slope is undefined.

## Intercept

The intercept of a line is the point where it crosses one of the axes. There are two types of intercepts: the x-intercept and the y-intercept.

### X-intercept

The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. To find the x-intercept, you set the y-coordinate equal to 0 and solve for the x-coordinate.

#### Example Problem

Find the x-intercept of the line y = 2x - 4.

Solution:

When y = 0, we have:

$$
0 = 2x - 4
$$

Solving for x, we get:

$$
x = 2
$$

Therefore, the x-intercept is (2, 0).

### Y-intercept

The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. To find the y-intercept, you set the x-coordinate equal to 0 and solve for the y-coordinate.

#### Example Problem

Find the y-intercept of the line y = -3x + 7.

Solution:

When x = 0, we have:

$$
y = -3(0) + 7
$$

Solving for y, we get:

$$
y = 7
$$

Therefore, the y-intercept is (0, 7).

## Axis

The axis of a graph is a line that divides it into quadrants. There are two types of axes: the x-axis and the y-axis.

### X-axis

The x-axis is the horizontal axis on a graph. It is used to measure the values of the x-coordinate.

### Y-axis

The y-axis is the vertical axis on a graph. It is used to measure the values of the y-coordinate.

## Curvature

The curvature of a graph is a measure of how sharply it changes direction. A graph can be concave or convex.

### Concave

A concave graph curves inward, like the inside of a bowl. For example, the graph of the function y = -x^2 is concave downward.

### Convex

A convex graph curves outward, like the outside of a dome. For example, the graph of the function y = x^2 is convex upward.

# Conclusion

Congratulations, you have learned about the Characteristics of Graphs! Remember that the slope measures the steepness of a line, the intercept is the point where it crosses one of the axes, the axis divides a graph into quadrants, and the curvature is a measure of how sharply it changes direction. Keep practicing and exploring this concept and you will find it easier to interpret graphs and solve problems.
