# Introduction
Hello everyone, welcome to the AP Chemistry lecture on the Structure of Ionic Solids. In this lesson, we will discuss the different aspects of ionic solids and how they form. Ionic solids are a type of crystal that is formed from ions that are held together by ionic bonds. These solids have characteristic physical and chemical properties that make them unique from other types of solids. Let us dive into the main contents of this lecture.

# Main Contents
## Definition
Ionic solids are crystals that are formed from ionic bonds between oppositely charged ions. They possess high melting points and are often brittle. Examples of ionic solids include NaCl, MgO, and CaF2.

## Crystal Lattice
Ionic solids exhibit a repeating pattern of ions in three dimensions, known as a crystal lattice. This is due to the strong electrostatic attraction between positive and negative ions that causes them to arrange themselves into a regular pattern. The crystal lattice of an ionic solid can be described as a regular arrangement of cations and anions.

## Coordination Number
Coordination number refers to the number of ions surrounding an ion in an ionic solid. It plays a crucial role in determining the overall structure of the solid. In general, the higher the coordination number, the more complex the structure of the solid. The coordination number of an ion is determined by its size and the distance between other ions. 

## Unit cell
The unit cell is the smallest repeating unit of the crystal lattice that contains the same arrangement of ions. It is used to describe the basic structure of an ionic solid.

## Simple Ionic Structures
Simple ionic structures are those in which all ions occupy one type of site in the lattice. These structures consist of two types of ions, a cation and an anion, arranged in an alternating pattern. Examples of simple ionic structures include rock salt, cesium chloride, and zinc blende.

## Complex Ionic Structures
Complex ionic structures are those in which different types of ions occupy different types of sites in the lattice. They possess a higher coordination number than simple ionic structures. Examples of complex ionic structures include perovskite, spinel, and garnet.

## Common Ionic Defects
Ionic solids often exhibit defects in their crystal structure due to missing or extra ions. These defects can significantly affect the physical and chemical properties of the solid. Some common ionic defects include Schottky defects, Frenkel defects, and impurity defects.

# Examples
Let us now solve some example problems to gain more understanding of the concept. 

## Example 1
What is the coordination number of NaCl? 

Solution: 
Each Na+ ion is surrounded by six Cl- ions and each Cl- ion is surrounded by six Na+ ions. Therefore, the coordination number for NaCl is 6.

## Example 2
What is the unit cell for CsCl? 

Solution: 
The unit cell for CsCl is body-centered cubic, which contains one Cs+ ion at the center and eight Cl- ions at the corners.

## Example 3
What is the coordination number for MgO? 

Solution: 
Mg2+ ion is smaller than most cations, while O2- ion is larger than most anions. MgO has an octahedral arrangement which means the Mg atoms are surrounded by six O atoms. Therefore, the coordination number is 6.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, we have learned that ionic solids are crystals that are formed from oppositely charged ions, held together by ionic bonds. These solids have characteristic physical and chemical properties, and their structure can be described as a regular arrangement of cations and anions. We have also discussed the different aspects of ionic solids, including crystal lattice, coordination number, unit cell, simple and complex ionic structures, and common ionic defects. Solving example problems further enhances our understanding of the concept. I hope that this lecture was informative and helpful. Thank you for tuning in!
