# Introduction

Hello everyone, and welcome to the Karu lesson on the structure of metals and alloys from Icy Tutors. In this lesson, we will be discussing the fundamental concept behind metals and alloys, understanding their chemical compositions and the different properties that make them unique. 

Metals are known for their unique properties, such as high strength, good conductivity, malleability, and ductility. These properties make metals ideal for many applications, ranging from construction to electronics. The atomic structure of metals and how the structure is affected by alloying elements is crucial to understanding these properties.

## Metallic Bonding

Metallic bonding is the force that holds metals together. In ionic bonding, atoms transfer electrons to form ions. In covalent bonding, atoms share electrons. However, in metallic bonding, the atoms in a metal share a collective pool of electrons, which hold the atoms together in a sea of electrons.

The metallic bond is responsible for many properties of metals, including their thermal and electrical conductivity, malleability, and ductility. $$Metal + sea ~of~ electrons \rightarrow Metallic ~bond$$ 

### Example problem: 

If an aluminum atom has 3 valence electrons and its metallic crystal structure has a coordination number of 12, how many metal atoms are there per unit cell? 

From our previous knowledge, we know that -- $$Coordination ~number = number ~of ~atoms ~touching ~a ~particular ~atom$$ Therefore, $$Number ~of ~atoms ~per ~unit ~cell = \frac{1}{12}\ x\ 12 = 1 $$ Thus, there is 1 aluminum atom per unit cell. 

## Crystalline Structure of Metals

Metals tend to form crystalline solids, which means their atoms are arranged in a highly ordered pattern. There are different types of crystalline structures, and each metal has its own unique structure, which affects their physical properties such as density, strength, and ductility. The unit cell is the smallest portion of the crystal lattice that displays the complete 3-dimensional pattern of the crystal structure. 

### Cubic Unit Cells 

There are three types of metallic crystal structures based on the shape of the unit cell; these are cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic. The most common type of metallic crystal structures are cubic. The cubic unit cell is a cube with atoms at each corner. This results in a coordination number of 6. $$Coordination~number = \frac{1}{4}\ x\ 8~corners~+~\frac{1}{2}\ x\ 6~faces = 6$$ 

### Tetragonal Unit Cells

Tetragonal unit cells are similar to cubic unit cells, but the lengths of two sides are different. The unit cell looks like a rectangular prism. $$Coordination~number~ = \frac{1}{4}\ x\ 8~corners~+~\frac{1}{2}\ x\ 6~faces = 6$$ 

### Orthorhombic Unit Cells

Orthorhombic unit cells have all different lengths of 3 sides and look like a rectangular prism. Orthorhombic cells have coordination numbers of 8.$$ Coordination~number= \frac{1}{4}\ x\ 8~corners~+~\frac{1}{2}\ x\ 6~faces~+~ \frac{1}{4}\ x\ 12~edges = 8 $$ 

### Example problem:

If Sodium has a BCC crystal structure, what is its coordination number? 

To solve this problem, we need to know that the coordination number for each ion in BCC is 8. So, the coordination number for Sodium is 8.

$$Coordination~number = 8 $$


## Alloys

Alloys are metallic compounds that are made by mixing two or more elements. The resulting alloy has unique physical and mechanical properties that are different from the individual elements that make up the alloy. Alloys are used to create materials with specific properties that cannot be achieved by using a single metal. 

### Example problem:

What is the weight percent of gold in an alloy that contains 20g of silver and 10g of gold? 

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total weight of the alloy. The total weight of the alloy is: 

$$20~g~+~10~g = 30~g$$

Then, we calculate the weight percent of gold:

$$\frac{10~g}{30~g}~x~100\%~=~33.33\%$$ 

Therefore, the weight percent of gold in the alloy is 33.33%.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the structure of metals and alloys is an essential concept to understand when studying materials science. Knowing about the metallic bonding, metallic crystal structures, and alloys help to understand the properties of metals and how alloying elements can tune their properties.
