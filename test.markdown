# Calculating Equilibrium Concentrations

## Introduction

Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on Calculating Equilibrium Concentrations from Icy Tutors. In this lesson, we will be discussing the concept of calculating equilibrium concentrations. Equilibrium is a state of balance where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. By understanding how to calculate equilibrium concentrations, we can determine how much of each reactant and product is present in a chemical reaction at equilibrium.

## Units

### Equilibrium Constant, K 

The equilibrium constant, K, relates the concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium. It is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products, raised to their stoichiometric coefficients, divided by the product of the concentrations of reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

$$K=\frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b}$$

where a, b, c, and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products A, B, C, and D, respectively.

### Equilibrium Concentrations

We can use the equilibrium constant to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products. The equilibrium concentrations depend on the initial concentrations of the reactants and the equilibrium constant. If K > 1, the equilibrium lies to the right, meaning that the product concentration is greater than the reactant concentration. If K < 1, the equilibrium lies to the left, meaning that the reactant concentration is greater than the product concentration. If K = 1, the reaction is at equilibrium.

Suppose we have the following chemical reaction:
$$A + B \rightarrow C + D$$

The equilibrium constant for the reaction is:

$$K=\frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}$$

Suppose the initial concentration of A is 0.1 M, the initial concentration of B is 0.2 M, and the concentration of C is initially zero. We want to find the equilibrium concentration of C when the equilibrium constant is K = 4.

To solve for the equilibrium concentration of C, we can use the equilibrium constant expression and an ICE table. An ICE table is a table that lists the initial concentration of each species, the change in concentration of each species, and the equilibrium concentration of each species.

|           | A   | B   | C   | D   |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Initial   | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0   | 0   |
| Change    | -x  | -x  | +x  | +x  |
| Equilibrium| 0.1-x| 0.2-x| x   | x   |

Plugging these values into the equilibrium constant expression, we get:

$$4 = \frac{x^2}{(0.1-x)(0.2-x)}$$

Solving for x, we get:

$x = 0.144 M$

Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of C is:

$$[C]_{eq} = x = 0.144 M$$

### Reaction Quotient, Q

The reaction quotient, Q, is similar to the equilibrium constant but is calculated using the concentrations of the reactants and products at any point during the reaction. If Q is less than K, the reaction will proceed forward to reach equilibrium. If Q is greater than K, the reaction will proceed in reverse to reach equilibrium. If Q equals K, the reaction is at equilibrium.

$$Q=\frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b}$$

### Le Châtelier's Principle

Le Châtelier's Principle predicts how changes in concentration, pressure, or temperature will affect the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction. 

Suppose we have the following chemical reaction:
$$A + B \rightleftharpoons C + D$$

#### Changes in Concentration

If we add more of a reactant, the equilibrium will shift to the right to consume the added reactant. If we remove a product, the equilibrium will shift to the right to produce more of the removed product.

If we add more of a product, the equilibrium will shift to the left to consume the added product. If we remove a reactant, the equilibrium will shift to the left to produce more of the removed reactant.

#### Changes in Pressure and Volume

If the pressure on a system is increased, the system will shift in the direction that will reduce the pressure. If the pressure on a system is decreased, the system will shift in the direction that will increase the pressure.

#### Changes in Temperature

If the temperature of a system is increased, the system will shift in the direction that will consume heat. If the temperature of a system is decreased, the system will shift in the direction that will produce heat.

## Example Problem

Suppose we have the following chemical reaction:
$$N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2NH_3(g)$$

At a certain temperature, the equilibrium constant for the reaction is K = 0.5. If we start with 0.2 M of N2 and 0.3 M of H2, what are the equilibrium concentrations of each species?

#### Solution

We can use an ICE table to determine the equilibrium concentrations of each species.

|           | N2  | H2  | NH3 |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|
| Initial   | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0   |
| Change    | -3x | -x  | +2x |
| Equilibrium| 0.2 - 3x | 0.3 - x | 2x |

Plugging these values into the equilibrium constant expression, we get:

$$0.5 = \frac{(2x)^2}{(0.2-3x)(0.3-x)^3}$$

Solving for x, we get:

$x = 0.0463 M$

Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations of N2, H2, and NH3 are:

$$[N_2]_{eq} = 0.2 - 3x = 0.066 M$$

$$[H_2]_{eq} = 0.3 - x = 0.254 M$$

$$[NH_3]_{eq} = 2x = 0.093 M$$


## Conclusion

In conclusion, calculating equilibrium concentrations is an important concept in understanding chemical equilibria. We can use the equilibrium constant to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products. The reaction quotient, Q, is similar to the equilibrium constant but is calculated using the concentrations of the reactants and products at any point during the reaction. Le Châtelier's Principle predicts how changes in concentration, pressure, or temperature will affect the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction. Remember to use an ICE table when solving equilibrium concentration problems and to always check to see if the reaction is at equilibrium.
