### Project Update: Spoke with Dodgers Data Analysts and SWEs

A couple of weeks ago, I reached out to some members of the LA Dodgers' Data Engineering Team to discuss some of the up-and-coming tools for DA and ML projects in the MLB. Fortunately, they have been willing to meeta few times to discuss my project, where they think it could improve and how it should be deployed. I can talk a bit more about this during my update presentation, but having a meeting with two of their team members was really my only progress during Spring Break.
