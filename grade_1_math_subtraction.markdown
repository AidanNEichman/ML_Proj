# Introduction
Hello everyone, welcome to the Karu lesson on Subtraction Word Problems. Today, we will learn how to solve subtraction word problems using different methods.

Subtraction is the process of finding the difference between two quantities or numbers. Subtraction word problems involve real-life scenarios in which we have to subtract two or more quantities to find the answer. These types of problems require a good understanding of mathematical concepts, such as subtraction, addition, and multiplication.

Before we begin, let's ensure we have a good understanding of subtraction and its properties.

## Subtraction 
Subtraction is a mathematical operation that involves finding the difference between two quantities or numbers. It is represented using the symbol '-' and can be performed using different methods, such as counting, subtracting by place value, and using number lines.

For example, if we want to find the difference between 10 and 5, we would subtract 5 from 10 to get 5. This can also be represented as 10 - 5 = 5.

## Properties of Subtraction
There are different properties of subtraction that make it easier to solve problems. These include the commutative, associative, and distributive properties.

The commutative property states that the order of subtraction does not affect the result. For example, 5 - 3 = 2 and 3 - 5 = -2, which means the difference is the same regardless of the order.

The associative property states that the grouping of numbers does not affect the result. For example, (7 - 3) - 2 = 2 and 7 - (3 - 2) = 6, which means the difference is the same regardless of how the numbers are grouped.

The distributive property states that subtraction can be distributed over addition or subtraction. For example, 6 - (3 + 2) = (6 - 3) - 2 = 1 and 6 - (3 - 2) = 6 - 3 + 2 = 5, which means the difference is the same regardless of how the subtraction is distributed over addition or subtraction. 

Now that we have a good understanding of subtraction and its properties, let's dive into solving subtraction word problems.

# Main Sections

## Part 1: One Step Subtraction Word Problems

One-step subtraction word problems involve finding the difference between two quantities using one step. We can use mental subtraction or writing out the problem to solve these types of problems.

### Example problem:
Amy had 10 pencils and she gave 3 to her friend. How many pencils does Amy have now?

Solution:
We need to subtract 3 from 10.
10 - 3 = 7
Amy has 7 pencils now.

## Part 2: Multi-step Subtraction Word Problems

Multi-step subtraction word problems involve finding the difference between two quantities using multiple steps. We can use a combination of addition, subtraction, and multiplication to solve these types of problems.

### Example problem:
Joe had a bag of 24 marbles. He gave 5 to his friend and then lost 3. How many marbles does he have now?

Solution:
First, we need to find the difference when Joe gave 5 marbles to his friend.
24 - 5 = 19

Next, we need to find the difference when Joe lost 3 marbles.
19 - 3 = 16

Joe has 16 marbles now.

## Part 3: Finding the Unknown Quantity in Subtraction Word Problems

Sometimes, we are given the difference and one quantity in a subtraction word problem and we have to find the other quantity. We can use addition or multiplication to solve these types of problems.

### Example problem:
Sara had 12 stickers and she gave 6 to her friend. How many stickers did Sara have before giving some to her friend?

Solution:
We need to find the unknown quantity, which is the number of stickers Sara had before giving some to her friend.
We can do this by adding 6 to the difference (12 - 6) to find the answer.
(12 - 6) + 6 = 12
Sara had 12 stickers before giving some to her friend.

# Example Problems

Now that we have covered the different methods to solve subtraction word problems, let's practice with some examples.

## Example 1:
Tom had 15 toys and he sold 8 of them. How many toys does he have now?

Solution:
We need to subtract 8 from 15 to find the answer.
15 - 8 = 7
Tom has 7 toys now.

## Example 2:
Sarah had 24 hairclips. She gave 7 to her friend and lost 3. How many hairclips does she have now?

Solution:
First, we need to find the difference when Sarah gave 7 hairclips to her friend.
24 - 7 = 17

Next, we need to find the difference when Sarah lost 3 hairclips.
17 - 3 = 14

Sarah has 14 hairclips now.

## Example 3:
Mike had some marbles and he gave 6 to his friend. Now he has 12 marbles. How many marbles did he have before giving some to his friend?

Solution:
We need to find the unknown quantity, which is the number of marbles Mike had before giving some to his friend.
We can do this by subtracting 6 from 12 to find the difference.
12 - 6 = 6
Mike had 6 marbles before giving some to his friend.
